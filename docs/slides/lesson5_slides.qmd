## Iteration styles

-   For-Loops

-   List Comprehension

-   Maps

## Consider the following pattern

```{pyodide}
def cool_function(x):
  return x + 1
```

. . .

```{pyodide}
my_list = [3, -35, 98, 2.3, 0, -3]

for i, element in enumerate(my_list):
  my_list[i] = cool_function(element)
print(my_list)

```

. . .

```{pyodide}
my_list = [3, -35, 98, 2.3, 0, -3]

new_list = []
for element in my_list:
  new_list.append(cool_function(element))
print(new_list)  
```

. . .

"Apply `cool_function()` to every element of `my_list`."

## List Comphrenension

When the final product of a For-Loop is a List and the For-Loop involves a single expression, it is common to write a short-hand via a "**List Comprehension"**:

```python         
[<expression> for <var> in <iterable>]
   ^^              ^^  
  Function         for loop
```

- Notice the `[]` - indicates we're outputting a list
- <expression> must use <var> as input
- <var> must iterate over <iterable>

```{pyodide}
my_list = [3,-35,-98]
[print(num) for num in my_list]
```

## Try it out

```{pyodide}
def cool_function(x):
  return x + 1

my_list = [3, -35, 98, 2.3, 0, -3]

my_list = [cool_function(element) for element in my_list]

print(my_list)
```

. . .

```{pyodide}
my_list = [3, -35, 98, 2.3, 0, -3]

new_list = [cool_function(element) for element in my_list]

print(new_list)
```

. . .

Step-by-step:

1.  Look at the first member of `my_list`, and assign it as `element`.
2.  Evaluate `cool_function(element)`, and the output value is stored as the first element of our output list.
3.  Proceed to the next member of `my_list` and assign it as `element`. Repeat steps 2, 3 until we're done.

## Practice with List Comprehensions

Guess what the following code will do:

```{pyodide}
my_list = [3, -35, 98, 2.3, 0, -3]

output = [element / 2 for element in my_list]
```

. . .

```{pyodide}
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "guava"]

output = [f.upper() for f in fruits]
```

. . .

```{pyodide}
output = [x for x in range(10)]
```

## Maps

How should we use iteration on the column of a Dataframe?

An extremely common iteration pattern is to apply a function to each element of the column (Series) to transform the data.

But first, perhaps there exist a function already that can be used on the column already:

```{pyodide}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

simple_df = pd.DataFrame(data={'id': ["AAA", "BBB", "CCC", "DDD", "EEE"],
                               'case_control': ["case", "case", "control", "control", "control"],
                               'measurement1': [2.5, 3.5, 9, .1, 2.2],
                               'measurement2': [0, 0, .5, .24, .003],
                               'measurement3': [80, 2, 1, 1, 2]})

np.log(simple_df.measurement1)
```

. . .

`np.log()` takes in a column (Series) as input. But what about functions whose input is a simple data type, such as `cool_function(x)`?

## Maps

A **map** (also known as a **functional**) is a function that takes in an iterable data structure and function as inputs and applies the function on the data structure, element by element. It *maps* your input iterable data structure to an output data structure based on the function.

. . .

. . .

```{pyodide}
simple_df.measurement1.map(cool_function)
```

## Maps for data recoding

Suppose we want to create cutoffs for the column "measurement1" using the following function:

```{pyodide}
def measurement1_cutoff_rule(x):
  if x > 0 and x < 2:
    return "low"
  elif x >= 2 and x < 7:
    return "medium"
  elif x >= 7:
    return "high"
  else:
    return "unknown"
```

. . .

We can map this function `measurement1_cutoff_rule()` to each element of "measurement1":

```{pyodide}
simple_df.measurement1.map(measurement1_cutoff_rule)
```

## Which iteration method to use?

In order of consideration:

-   When you can, use existing functions and methods that can carry out the iteration task. For example, if you want to compute the mean value of a Dataframe's column, use the `.mean()` method. It will be much more efficient iterating via a For-Loop because it has been optimized.

. . .

-   If you need to use a function on each element of a Dataframe's column, such as data recoding, use the `.map()` method to help with the iteration.

. . .

-   If your desired output is a List and the task of iteration is a single expression, consider writing a List Comprehension.

. . .

-   When working with iterable data structures, For-Loops are the most general purpose.

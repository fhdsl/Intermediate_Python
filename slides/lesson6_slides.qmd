## Goals of the course

. . .

-   Continue building *programming fundamentals*: How to use complex data structures, how to iterate repeated tasks, and write your own functions.

. . .

-   Continue exploration of *data science fundamentals*: how to clean messy data using the programming fundamentals above to a Tidy form for analysis.

## What have we covered in 6 weeks?

-   Iterable data structures: Lists, Strings, Dictionaries, Tuples,

    -   Access elements via `[ ]`

    -   For Loops

    -   Length via `len()`

    -   Check for presence of elements via `in`

## What have we covered in 6 weeks?

-   Dictionaries vs Lists

    -   Access elements via `[ ]` vs. `.get()` method

## What have we covered in 6 weeks?

-   Iteration

    -   For loops

        -   Classic form `for value in my_list:`

        -   Modify the data structure via `for index, value in enumerate(my_list):`

        -   Creating a new list via `new_list.append(element)`

    -   List comprehension

    -   Maps when working with Dataframes

. . .

-   Conditional statements

    -   Within For loops

. . .

-   Writing your own function :)

## What's next?

-   An important lesson I didn't get to: [Reference vs. Copy](https://hutchdatascience.org/Intermediate_Python/06-Reference_vs_Copy.html)

-   [Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/)

-   Stay tuned for future classes...

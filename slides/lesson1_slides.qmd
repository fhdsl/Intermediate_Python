## Culture of the course

. . .

-   Challenge: We are learning a new language, but you already have a full-time job

. . .

-   *Teach not for mastery, but teach for empowerment to learn effectively.*

## Culture of the course

-   Challenge: We sometimes struggle with our data science in isolation, unaware that someone two doors down from us has gone through the same struggle.

. . .

-   *We learn and work better with our peers.*

. . .

-   *Know that if you have a question, other people will have it.*

. . .

We ask you to follow [Participation Guidelines](https://hutchdatascience.org/communitystudios/guidelines/) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/fhdsl/coc).

## Data types

| Data type name | **Data type shorthand** |      **Examples**       |
|----------------|:-----------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| Integer        |           int           |          2, 4           |
| Float          |          float          |      3.5, -34.1009      |
| String         |           str           | "hello", "234-234-8594" |
| Boolean        |          bool           |       True, False       |

. . .

There is a special `None` data type that shows up when nothing is returned from an expression.

## Data structures

-   List

-   Dataframe

-   **Dictionary**

-   **Tuple**

## Objects in Python

*What does it contain?*

. . .

-   **Value** that holds the essential data for the object.

. . .

-   **Attributes** that hold subset of the data or additional data for the object.

. . .

*What can it do?*

-   Functions called **Methods** specific to the data type and automatically takes the object as input.

. . .

This organizing structure on an object applies to pretty much all Python data types and data structures.

## Lists as an Object

*What does it contain?*

-   **Value**: the contents of the list, such as `[2, 3, 4]`.

. . .

-   **Attributes**: subsetting via `[ ]`.

. . .

*What can it do (methods)?*

-   `my_list.append(4)` appends 4 to the last element of `my_list`, but does not return anything.

. . .

What's the difference between a method and a function?

## Dataframe as an Object

*What does it contain?*

-   **Value**: the spreadsheet of data.

. . .

-   **Attributes**:

    -   Columns of the data

    -   `.columns`

    -   `.shape`

    -   `.iloc[ , ]` , `.loc[ , ]` for subsetting

        -   [a technical syntax guide](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NmFx2tK0coi2O44eldz8RHDH6POOmAFE?usp=sharing)

. . .

*What can it do (methods)?*

-   `.head()`

-   `.tail()`

## Break!

A quick survey to get us started: <https://forms.gle/kUJtevu2XynKQRq4A>

## Dictionary

A **dictionary** is designed as a lookup table, organized in **key-value** pairs. You associate the key with a particular value, and use the key to find the value.

. . .

```{python}
sentiment = {'happy': 8, 'sad': 2, 'joy': 7.5, 'embarrassed': 3.6, 'restless': 4.1, 'apathetic': 3.8, 'calm': 7}
sentiment
```

. . .

You use a key to find its corresponding value:

```{python}
sentiment['joy']
```

. . .

You cannot use a numerical index to find values, like you did for Lists!

```{python}
#sentiment[0]
```

## Rules of Dictionaries

-   Only one value per key. No duplicate keys allowed.

. . .

-   **Keys** must be of string, integer, float, boolean, or tuple.

. . .

-   **Values** can be of any type, including data structures such as lists and dictionaries.

. . .

```{python}
duplicated_keys = {'Student' : 97, 'Student': 88, 'Student' : 91}
duplicated_keys
```

. . .

```{python}
child = {"name" : "Emil", "year" : 2004, "likes": ["jumping", "skating", "laughing"]}
```

. . .

```{python}
child["likes"][1]
```

. . .

Data stored in nested dictionaries are often represented as JSON files. Here's a [guide on using JSON files in Python](https://realpython.com/python-json/).

## Using key to find values

```{python}
sentiment['joy'] 
```

. . .

```{python}
sentiment['joy'] = sentiment['joy'] + 1
```

. . .

If a key doesn't exist, you will get an error:

```{python}
#sentiment["dog"]
```

. . .

If you don't want to run the risk of getting an error, you can specify a default value using the `.get()` method.

```{python}
sentiment.get("dog", "not found")
```

. . .

```{python}
print(sentiment.get("dog"))
```

## Adding new key-value pairs

You can add more key-value pairs by defining it directly. If the key already exists, the mapping for that key will simply be updated.

```{python}
sentiment['dog'] = 5
```

## Application: Creating a Dataframe

You can create a Dataframe using a Dictionary. The key represent column names, and the value is a List containing the column's values:

```{python}
import pandas as pd

simple_df = pd.DataFrame(data={'id': ["AAA", "BBB", "CCC", "DDD", "EEE"],
                               'case_control': ["case", "case", "control", "control", "control"],
                               'measurement1': [2.5, 3.5, 9, .1, 2.2],
                               'measurement2': [0, 0, .5, .24, .003],
                               'measurement3': [80, 2, 1, 1, 2]})
                               
simple_df
```

## Application: Data Recoding

You want to take "case_control" column of `simple_df` and change "case" to "experiment" and "control" to "baseline".

This correspondence relationship can be stored in a dictionary via `.replace()` method for Series:

```{python}
simple_df.case_control.replace({"case": "experiment", "control": "baseline"})
```

. . .

You can do something similar to recode the column names of a Dataframe via the [.rename()](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.rename.html) method.

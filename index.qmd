# About this course {.unnumbered}

The course continues building programming fundamentals in Python programming and data analysis. You will learn how to make use of complex data structures, iterate repeated tasks that scales naturally, and create your own functions. You will apply these skills to develop a custom data analysis.

## Target Audience

The course is intended for researchers who want to continue learning the fundamentals of Python programming and how to write custom data analysis functions when dealing with messy datasets. The audience should know how to work with Lists and Pandas Dataframes and conduct basic data analysis, and/or have taken our [Intro to Python](https://hutchdatascience.org/Intro_to_Python/) course.

## Learning Objectives

-   **Understand and distinguish** the use case of data structures to store different types of data.

-   **Implement** code to Iterate over a collection (such as files, elements of a column, or a list of objects) to batch process each item.

-   **Implement** code that has a branching structure depending on input data's condition.

-   **Create** simple, modular functions that can be reused.

-   **Describe** the difference between copying an object vs. referencing an object and how that could affect variables in a data analysis.

* = Ted on Campus for class

In class we will be going through the notebooks hosted on Google Classroom. 

Classes will be recorded, and those recordings will be sent to you after each class.


## Format of Class

The course will be taught in a hybrid form. Come to M1-B406 to learn in-person, and enjoy the snacks. Or join online via the Teams on your calendar.

We will spend the first 20-25 minutes of each class on catching up on last week's exercises if you haven't had the opportunity to work on them. Followed by that, we will have a short lecture/lab, where we will go through the notebooks for the week.

## First Class Survey

[First Class Survey](https://forms.gle/smj4wFAQufoHsG6h7) - Please fill out. We mostly want to see how confident you are before and after class. We will share these results with everyone (anonymized).

## Weekly Check In

[Weekly Check In Form](https://forms.gle/obwC5GYAA3iPHk5x7) - please fill out to let us know if you have any issues or want to share what you've learned. We look at the answers in aggregate and we anonymize responses (unless you want us to know).


## Culture of the course

-   Learning on the job is challenging
    -   I will move at learner's pace; we are learning together.
    -   Teach not for mastery, but teach for empowerment to learn effectively.

We sometimes struggle with our data science in isolation, unaware that someone two doors down from us has gone through the same struggle.

-   *We learn and work better with our peers.*
-   *Know that if you have a question, other people will have it.*
-   *Asking questions is our way of taking care of others.*

We ask you to follow [Participation Guidelines](https://ocdo.fredhutch.org/dasl/participation-guidelines/) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/fhdsl/coc). Be respectful of others and their learning pace in class.
